# Analysis and Forecast of Hotel Reviews 

This notebook contains a brief analysis and prediction of hotel reviews using natural language processing techniques. The dataset used was obtained from Kaggle and consists of a sample of guest reviews of a hotel.

## Dataset
The dataset contains a series of guest reviews of the hotel along with their ratings. Each record in the dataset has two main columns:

- review_full: Text containing the review written by the guest.
- rating_review: Rating given by the guest, ranging from 1 to 5 stars.

The purpose of this notebook is to explore the data, perform an analysis, and then build a machine learning model to predict the ranking of new reviews.

## Data analysis
Before building the forecast model, it is important to understand the data we are dealing with. In this section, we will perform an exploratory analysis of the data.

## Text Preprocessing
As we are dealing with evaluations written in text format, it is necessary to perform some pre-processing to make the data suitable for modeling. In this step, techniques such as tokenization, stop words removal, stemming, punctuation removal, among others, will be applied.

## Modeling
After pre-processing, we will build a machine learning model to predict guest review ratings. In this notebook, we will use a supervised learning approach, where we will train the model with the evaluations and their corresponding classifications.

## Conclusion
This notebook presented an analysis and prediction of hotel reviews using natural language processing techniques. Data were explored, text was pre-processed, and a machine learning model was built to predict evaluation ratings.
